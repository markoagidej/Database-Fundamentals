Database Normalization Analysis

1NF:
This database meets the first level of normalization.
Every single column in all tables only holds a single value.
This can be seen by every table having a primary key.

2NF:
This database meets the second level of normalization.
All non-primary key columns are dependent on the primary key.
There is no non non-primary key that can be used to find the same entry in a table.
Even for Author and Customer, name could potentially be the same between two different people, thus name depends on id.

3NF:
This database meets the third level of normalization.
There are no instances of non-primary key columns depending on each other.
