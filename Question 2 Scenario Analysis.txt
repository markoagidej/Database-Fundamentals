## Question 2 Task 4 Scenario Analysis

Due to the one-to-one relationship between the Rental_Agreements and Vehicles tables, there can only ever be one Rental Agreement entry per vehicle.
No Rental Agreement can be made without a vehicle.
Any amount of vehicles can be made.
Once a Rental Agreement is made, there can not be another agreement made wit hteh same car until the current one is complete and presumably removed from the table.
Updates to Rental Agreement entries are unrestricted to email, start, and end dates. A vehicle could be updated as long there is not another entry using that vehicle.
To check if a vechicle is available, we woudl simply see if the vin is in the Rental_Agreements vehicle_vin column.
