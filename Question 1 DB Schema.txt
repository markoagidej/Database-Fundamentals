# Database-Fundamentals
## Question 1 DB Schema

This database will require 4 tables:
1. Books
2. Authors
3. Customers
4. Transactions

Each table will require the following fields:
### 1. Books:
PK - isbn TEXT(13) NOT NULL
   - title TEXT NOT NULL
FK - author_id INT NOT NULL
   - quantity_in_stock INT NOT NULL
   - price DECIMAL NOT NULL

### 2. Authors
PK - id INT AUTO_INCREMENT
   - name TEXT NOT NULL
FK1- collaborator_id INT NULL

### 3. Customers
PK - id INT AUTO_INCREMENT
   - name TEXT NOT NULL

### 4. Transactions
PK - id INT AUTO_INCREMENT
FK - customer_id INT NOT NULL
FK - book_isbn TEXT(13) NOT NULL
FK - book_price INT NOT NULL
   - quantity_sold INT NOT NULL
  
There will also need to be key relationships between the tables, defined as follows:
Every book will need a single author_id. An author can have many books
Each Transaction represents a book sold to a customer, so it will need a customer_id, book_isbn, and book_price.
A Customer should be able to buy multiple books in different transactions, and even be able to repeat the same exact order they made prevoiously.
